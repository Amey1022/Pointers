# Pointers
## Aim:
To study and implement C++ pointers basics.

## Software Used:
Visual Studio Code.

## Theory:
A pointer in C++ is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Pointers are used for dynamic memory allocation, arrays, and functions.
## Algorithms:
Displaying Pointer Information:<br>
Start.<br>
Declare an integer variable var and initialize it to 10.<br>
Declare an integer pointer ptr.<br>
Assign the address of var to ptr using the address-of operator &.<br>
Display the value of var.<br>
Display the address of var.<br>
Display the value stored in ptr (which is the address of var).<br>
Display the value pointed to by ptr using the dereference operator.<br>
End.<br>
